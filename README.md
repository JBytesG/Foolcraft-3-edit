To add this as a modpack to your curseforge go to the plus sign in the corner of your minecraft modpacks and add a new pack.
Set the version of the new pack to 1.12.2 and name it whatever you want.
Then right click the modpack and select open folder to open the modpack in explorer. 
Copy the config and mod folders from this repo and paste them into the folder that opens, if it ask about replacing files tell it to replace them.
After that you should be ready to play.
